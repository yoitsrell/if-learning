# If Else Exercise

Function Specifications:

* Write a function called `isItLong` that returns the string `'That's a long string!'` if the given string is longer than 20 characters. It should not return anything otherwise. (Explicitly, at least--every function returns `undefined` if you don't `return` a value!)
* Write a function called `isItMedium` that returns the string `'That's a regular sized string!'` if the given string is between 10 and 20 characters, inclusive. It should not return anything otherwise. 
* Write a function called `isItShort` that returns `'That's a small string!'` if the given string is shorter than 10 characters. It should not return anything otherwise. 
* Write a function called `howLongIsMyString` that returns:
  * the string `'That's a long string!'` if the given string is longer than 20 characters
  * the string `'That's a regular sized string!'` if the given string is between 10 and 20 characters, inclusive
  * the string `'That's a small string!'` if the given string is shorter than 10 characters
* Write a function called `instructorHeight` that returns the height of your instructors, in inches. If given the string `'Colin'` it should return the number `62`. If given the string `'Mesuara'`, it should return the number `67`. If given anything else, it should return the string `"I don\'t know that instructor!"`.
